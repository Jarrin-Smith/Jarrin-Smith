/**
 * In this class, we will maintain the list of words much more efficiently
 * by sharing common prefixes.
 *
 * Say we have a tiny dictionary with these words:
 *
 *                 "to", "tea", "ted", "ten", "in", "inn", "A"
 *
 * Instead of storing them as a list of strings, we will store them this way:
 *
 *                                ""
 *                           /    /      \
 *                       "A"*   "I"         "T"
 *                              /        /      \
 *                            "N"*    "O"*       "E"
 *                           /               /    |     \
 *                         "N"*           "A"*   "D"*   "N"*
 *
 * A word stored as a sequence of letters stored at tree nodes. The path from
 * the root to any leaf is definitely a word. But it is also possible that
 * a complete word is a prefix of another (e.g. "in" is a prefix of "inn" and
 * both are valid words). To distinguish these situations from prefixes
 * like "te" that are not words themselves, we use a marker (*) in the picture
 * above to record when a particular internal node is also a complete word.
 *
 * In other to implement such tree, we have an additional small challenge:
 * the number of nodes is irregular. Sometimes we have 0 children, sometimes 1,
 * and sometimes many. To accommodate this variation, we will collect all
 * the children in a Hashtable whose keys are letters and whose values
 * are the trees rooted at each character.
 *
