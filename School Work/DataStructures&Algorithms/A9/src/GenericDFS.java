     * All the algorithms we are implementing for this assignment are variations on this
     * generic DFS traversal. Ignoring the consumers for a moment the traversal is
     * implemented as:
     *
     *     void traverse(Node u) {
     *         if (u.isVisited()) {}
     *         else {
     *             u.setVisited();
     *             neighbors.get(u).forEach(this::traverse);
     *         }
     *
     * To traverse the graph starting from node u, we first check if u has been
     * previously visited to avoid infinite loops. If u has never been visited,
     * then we mark as visited and recursively traverse its immediate neighbors.
     * That's it.
     *
     * This skeleton is expressive enough to implement various interesting algorithms;
     * we show four of them in this assignment;
     * - topological sorting
     * - cycle detection
     * - "normal" depth first search
     * - reachability analysis
     * Each algorithm is implemented by simply varying the actions taken at the various
     * moments during the traversal, i.e., by passing in different consumers.
     *
     * Each file has additional explanation relevant to the algorithm in question.
