## 🧠 About Me
I'm a Computer Science graduate from Indiana University with a concentration in Software Engineering. My experience spans backend development, data automation, and MES systems. I’ve built tools that validate thousands of production records, detect anomalies in test data, and streamline shift reporting — all using Python, SQL, and cloud-native workflows.

I thrive at the intersection of software, data, and manufacturing systems, and I’m currently upskilling in cloud data engineering to transition into full-time data roles.
